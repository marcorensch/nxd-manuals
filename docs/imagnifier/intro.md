# Introduction

## What is iMagnifier?

iMagnifier renders the selected image to 100% of the available width at your predefined module position or within a
post. A mouseover will show you a magnifying glass to show parts of the image in original size. If only one image is
set/used, the same image is used for preview and detail. You can set the zoom level by the original size of the image (
if you work with one image source) or the second image (HiRes image).

The size & type of the magnifier can be adjusted via module Backend Options. On touch devices iMagnifier works via
touch & hold.

iMagnifier can use static sources in combination with articles as well as dynamic sources (article customfields). So it
is possible to use the same module instance in different articles with different sources (images). iMagnifier can also
be used in dynamic template systems.

## System Requirements

The minimum system requirements are not terrific:

- Joomla 3.9.0 or later
