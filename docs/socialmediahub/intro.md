# Introduction

## What is SocialMedia Hub for Joomla?

The SocialMedia Hub extension for Joomla! consists of a component and additional modules for embedding posts from
Instagram accounts/Facebook pages directly on your site.

This component is used to link your social media accounts. The component then loads the content from your sources at
regular intervals and stores local copies of it in your database.

The module allows you to embed the loaded posts directly on your website.
