A centrepiece of the component is the translation of Joomla! language files. Joomet can translate uploaded language 
files or language files from locally installed Joomla extensions for you using DeepL.

To be able to use the translation services of DeepL, you must enter your DeepL API key in the Joomet parameters and 
generate a local language cache.
