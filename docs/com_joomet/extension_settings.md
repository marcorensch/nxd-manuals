## General

### Show List Filters by default

Set this option to yes so that the filters are visible by default in the list views if filters are available.

## Checker

Overrides the maximum time in seconds that the PHP script may run before an error is thrown. If problems occur when 
checking an extremely large file, this value can be increased.

### Ignore Empty Rows

If enabled empty rows want to show up for translation - but they still got copied to the new language file.

### Ignore Comments

If this option is activated, lines with comments are not displayed in the translation overview. These are copied to 
the new language file in the original language.

At this point, access is controlled by user group. Individual options such as the export of checker reports, the 
ability to check or translate files can be deactivated here for individual user groups if required.
