# Image Links

The module supports also so-called image cards. You can define a title, an icon and an image for each link. The optional
image will be used as background.

<img src="/img/nxd-quickicons/blurred.jpeg" alt="Image Cards" />

## Background Blur on Hover

As you can see in some screenshots the image is blurred on hover. To enable this feature you have to set the
class name in the Custom Class List field in the item settings. The blurred class name is `blurred`:
<img src="/img/nxd-quickicons/blurred-custom-classlist.jpeg" alt="Image Cards Blurred Option" />

As you might think the effect only affects QuickLinks with Background images and can be set separately for each item.
