# Shadow Gallery Usage

This module contains a huge amount of 70 (!) predefined Shadow Styles ready to use. To use one you need to set
the `Select Effect` Field in the Styling Tab to **Shadow** and the `Insert Mode` to **Field**. Click now on one of the
Shadow Options will set the correct CSS into the Shadow CSS Field and overwrites previously entered Styles there.
