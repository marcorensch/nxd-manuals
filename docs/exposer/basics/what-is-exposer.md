# What is Exposer?
<p>Exposer from nx-designs is a Joomla! 3.x module designed to display Joomla! articles and Joomla! contacts. Main focus was put on the use of this module on start pages or overview pages. The module supports various layouts for the presentation of the articles or contacts. In the current version (1.2.0) these are: a grid layout, a slideshow and a list view of the articles. The Exposer module filters the articles to be displayed by categories and / or Joomla! tags. Furthermore, the number of articles or contacts to be displayed and the sorting of these can be adjusted with a wide variety of options.</p>
<p>Exposer can display Joomla! articles or Joomla! contacts based on your setup but can not mix both into one view.</p>
<p>Exposer was designed so that Joomla! articles no longer necessarily be understood as full-page articles on a single topic. Rather, Exposer opens the door with (especially) the Modal function to create more than just articles with the Article component. Articles can also be people, devices or services with Exposer. In combination with other extensions that have the same goal, a lot can be achieved with very little effort.</p>

## Framework
<p>The implementation of the UIkit 3 framework opens up completely new dimensions of visualization options. The mainframe of Exposer supports the you in preparing the content by providing different positions per template. Within these positions different contents of the respective article can be placed. More information is available on our product page or in the manual. Each of these positions can be supplemented by own CSS classes in the backend. So it is possible to use your own classes of your template directly within the module to adapt the look & feel of your design.</p>

## Custom Fields Support
<p>Besides the support of tags for filtering, Exposer is also able to process the information from the article customfields and can sort the elements by customfield values. For example, it is possible to sort a team list by player number that is stored within a customfield. (Example: https://calandabroncos.ch/index.php/teams/seniors)</p>
