# Articles

<p class="lead">Still here? Good! Let's get another fresh cup of coffee and start with the next step. Letâ€™s create our articles.</p>

Articles in Joomla host the site content and can be used in several ways. In Joomla! 3.x many new features were
introduced that have strongly influenced the ways and methods of using articles. Modules like our Exposer take advantage
of these innovations and allow you to do much more with your articles than just creating simple posts.

## Create an Article

To start we can (if we are still on the category view from before) just click on articles in the menu on the left. If
you are somewhere else in the Joomla! backend you can click on Content in the main menu above and then on Article to get
to the following screen:

<img src="/img/articles_list_empty.jpg" alt="Empty Articles" className="bordered full-width" />

This page shows a list of all articles of your website - at this point again the hint: If you have installed Joomla!
including demo content there might be articles already listed here. But we don't let this iritate us and simply create
new ones by clicking the button New in the upper left corner.

A click on new takes us to the so-called Article Edit Screen. On this screen you can edit the respective article and
fill it with content. We will now go through some points that are relevant for us. A complete overview of all options
can be found as always in the Official Joomla! Docs.

## We are editing an article

The article edit screen is dominated by the editor, this usually contains the text content of the article, intro text
and full text of the article are stored here, also marked in <span class="marked marked-orange">orange</span> on our
screenshot is the title field which contains the heading of the article.

On the right side (marked <span class="marked marked-blue">blue</span>) we find the basic article options, they control
if the article should be displayed and which category the article belongs to. The fact that there are tabs between the
title and the content editor should not be ignored, the two tabs marked in <span class="marked marked-red">red</span>
have fields that are useful for us and we will look at them in detail in a moment.

## Create some Content

First of all we give our article a fitting name, how about: "I need coffee". Sounds good...
As text I get some lorem ipsum as a placeholder for the text area, I don't know if it is called something else in your
native language but here is a generator for dummy texts if you need one: [Dummy Text Generator](https://loremipsum.de/).

Our article now looks like this:

<img src="/img/article_edit_c1.jpg" alt="Article Edit" className="bordered full-width" />

That's enough for now, now we have to make sure that we have assigned the article to the correct category, for this we
select our previously created category from the dropdown list on the right. Please also make sure that the status here
is set to Published and the Access is set to Public. Exposer and other extensions can also display articles that have a
different access, but the user who is viewing the website must also have the appropriate access level. To make it short:
Make the article public and everyone will see the article and we don't have to worry about that right now.

So far so good, we have now filled an article with content, assigned it to our category and set the status and access
level correctly. Now we save this article with the button in the upper left corner (<span class="marked marked-green">
Save</span>),
**not Save & Close**. After saving, we can now copy our article and save some time.

## Copy an Article

For this we click after saving on the new button Save as Copy which has now appeared:
<img src="/img/saveascopy.jpg" alt="Article Edit Save as Copy" className="bordered full-width" />

A click on this button creates a new article and copies all contents of this article there. We are also automatically
forwarded to the edit mask of the **NEW** article:

<img src="/img/copied_article.jpg" alt="Article Edit copied Article" className="bordered full-width" />

As you can see the whole thing doesn't really look any different than before, only the options for titles, aliases have
been given one (2) (since a copy of the first article) and the status has been automatically set to unpublished. Again,
this is now a new article. Our first article from before is still here, still published and ready to use. But we will
now also launch this new, second article.

This time in short form:

1. Change the title from I need coffee! (2) to My coffee is cold!
2. Change the Alias to my-coffee-is-cold (the alias is the named id of your article, for us not really necessary but
   needs to be unique)
3. Set the Status to published
4. Category should be already correct setted up to your previously created category

This time we click on save and close and are forwarded to the article overview:

<img src="/img/article_overview_two_art.jpg" alt="Article Edit copied Article" className="bordered full-width" />

We can now see the following in the article overview:

- We have two articles, the status of both articles is published (green tick).
- Both articles are assigned to the category "hello joomla!" (visible below the article title).
- The access for both articles is set to public.
- In addition, we see in the last column that Joomla! has automatically set an article ID, this is unique.

Each new article receives the next higher ID, so if we now create a third article, this would get the ID 48 on my
installation here, the next then 49 and so on - we remember this now just so ok?

**Know what?** I think you are ready to create a third and fourth article now by yourself, be a bit creative and create new
articles with title and content, categorize them identically to our first examples, and we will see us in the next
chapter.
