# Categories

This Extension is Joomla-Article-Based, which means it can only display things that are already on your site. At best,
this content are articles that are categorized or tagged with TAGS. So in order to display something on your
site, we need to do some "pre-work" on an empty installation (which is necessary anyway).

In short, categories are like chapters in a book or... Sections in a folder (a real folder, with paper, hence the
name... not the folders on your desktop :smiley: ).
To learn more about categories in Joomla... yes you know how the sentence
ends -> [Joomla Docs Categories](https://docs.joomla.org/Category)

## Create a Category

Navigate in the Joomla! backend to the menu entry Content --> Categories, you will see the following view:
<img src="/img/cats_empty.jpg" alt="Empty Categories" className="bordered" />

> **Please Note:** If you have already created categories, you will see them here. If you have created categories

We now simply create a new category using the button "New" in the upper left corner:

<img src="/img/hello_joomla_cat.jpg" alt="New Category" className="bordered" />

There is not much to do here, just enter a title (hello joomla!) and some Description text. Take care that the Status on
the right side of the screen is set to Published and the Access to Public.

Finally, we click on Save & Close, the list of categories should now have been extended by our new category:

<img src="/img/cat_created.jpg" alt="New Category" className="bordered" />

And that's it in the next step we create some demo articles.
