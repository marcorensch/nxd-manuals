# Installation

<p class="lead">
Starting from Zero we got our blank Joomla installation and a lot of Question marks...
</p>

So let's start at the beginning and install our component / module / plugin first. For this we log in to the Joomla!
backend (the administration interface) of your site and navigate via the menu above to ``Extensions`` --> ``Manage`` -->
``Install``:

<img src="/img/install.png" alt="Joomla Installation" className="bordered" />

In the installation dialog we select the tab Upload Package File. With the **green** button (Or browse for file) we can
select and install the downloaded ZIP file of the extension.

<img src="/img/install_2.jpg" alt="Joomla Installation" className="bordered" />

The green success message acknowledges the installation dialog after only a few seconds:

<img src="/img/installation_done.jpg" alt="Joomla Installation" className="" />

The extension is now installed, most components are listed in the menu via Components after the installation.
Modules are listed in the menu under ``Extensions`` --> ``Modules`` and Plugins under ``Extensions`` --> ``Plugins``.

To learn more about the different extension types I recommend to start the search engine of your choice and search for
the keyword "Difference between Joomla components modules and plugins".
