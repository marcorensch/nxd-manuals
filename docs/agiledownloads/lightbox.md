# Lightbox

The Lightbox is a feature of the **professional version** of this module. It allows to display the supported filetypse
in a lightbox.

<div class="alert alert--info">
<b>Please Note:</b><br/>The Lightbox can not support PDF files on <b>mobile devices</b>. This is due to the fact that the PDF files 
are for security reasons got opened in a new browser window / tab and no longer inside an iFrame. Some mobile Browsers 
shows an image of the first page of the PDF. This is **not** a bug of this module.
</div>

<br/>

When the Lightbox Feature is enabled you can add a comma-separated list of file extensions to the module settings to define which file types
should be displayed in the lightbox. For example: `jpg, jpeg, png, gif, svg`.

Additionally, you can define the size of the lightbox Caption as well as if there should be a download button displayed.
