# Search

In the **professional version** of this module, an integrated search or filter has been integrated. This
allows to search the listed documents. During the input, the contents are filtered based on the name.

The search can be activated in the module settings in `Modules > Use Search`. Currently, there are no
additional options available.

In the frontend, a search field is then displayed right-justified above the files:

Checkout the Lightbox Demo on the [Product Page](https://nx-designs.ch/ext/agile-downloads#demos) to see the search in action.
