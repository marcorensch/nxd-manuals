# Label Custom Rules

Custom rules can be used to adjust file labels. The original file & names are not manipulated by this. The options
allow you to create labels based on your filenames by defining rules to manipulate the given filename string. So you
can create a nice looking label like 'My Video Title' from the filename 'My_Video_Title.mp4' simply by creating a
replacement rule for '_'.
