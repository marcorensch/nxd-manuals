# External Sources

External sources can be videos that are stored on Youtube, Vimeo or an external server. You can create groups for these
sources on this page and embed them additionally. The covers as well as the metadata for creation date or modification
date cannot be loaded from external sources, therefore videos in the ungrouped overview may be displayed first.
