# Module Tab

## Watched Folders

Watched Folders are the linchpin of this module. Here you specify the folders that should be watched by the module. If
new content is loaded into the corresponding folders, these are automatically used in the frontend. You can add as many
Watched Folders as you want. If you want to change the order of the Watched Folders, you can do this by dragging the
rows.
To add a new Watched Folder, click on the ``+`` button.

### Watched Folder

You can enter a folder path (relative to the Joomla! root directory WITHOUT leading slash) manually or open the folder
selector by clicking on the ``Select`` option. Here you can select the folder you want to add.

<img src="/img/agileVideos/folder_select.jpg" alt="Select Watched Folder" className="bordered" />
<p class="meta text-center">Select Watched Folder</p>

### Section Title

Here you can enter a title for the section. This title is displayed in the frontend above the videos of this Watched
Folder. The option [**Grouped by Source**](#grouped-by-source) (see below) must be activated for this to work.

### Recursive

If you want to include all subfolders of the selected folder, you can activate this option. This is useful if you have a
huge amount of videos and want to organize them in subfolders. The Videos will all be shown in a single section.

### Restrict Access ðŸ”¥

If you want to restrict access to the videos in this section, you can enable this option here. Only users who are logged
in will be able to see the videos in this section. Additionally, this option will block access to the video files from
outside by placing a ``.htaccess`` file in the folder.

**Note:** The agileVideos module does not support advanced permission settings at the file level. It currently
distinguishes
only registered users and guests. So it can only be used for *simple* file protection.

**Note:** This protection function uses the standard htaccess protection with the help of a backend script and can therefore
only be used on Apache web servers. Microsoft server installations are currently **not** supported.

## Sort by

Here you can select the sorting of the videos in the frontend. You can choose between the following options:

- ``Modified Timestamp``: Sorts the videos by the date of the last modification of the video file.
- ``Created Timestamp``: Sorts the videos by the date of the last modification of the video file.
- ``Name``: Sorts the videos by the name of the video file.

<div class="alert alert--info">
    <p><strong>Please Note:</strong> On some Server Systems there is no difference between the Modified and Created 
        Timestamps (There exists only the Modified one). This is not a bug of the Module or Joomla! it's simply 
        how your Server works. On Those Systems the Modified Timestamp will be used for both options.
    </p>
</div>

## Sorting Direction

Here you can select the sorting direction of the videos in the frontend. You can choose between the following options:

- ``Ascending``: Sorts the videos in ascending order.
- ``Descending``: Sorts the videos in descending order.

## Grouped by Source

If you have multiple Watched Folders, you can activate this option to group the videos by the Watched Folder they are
in.
Please note that the [**Section Title**](#section-title) of the Watched Folder will be used as the title of the group.

## Group Container Class

Here you can enter a custom CSS class for the group container. This is useful if you want to style the groups. You can
add multiple classes by separating them with a space.

my-class another-class
