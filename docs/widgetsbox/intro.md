# Introduction

## What is WidgetsBox?

WidgetsBox is a Content-Driven Module for Joomla! that allows you to create beautiful and responsive widgets, based on
your Joomla! Articles with ease. Every Item in WidgetsBox is a Joomla! Article. That Way you can publish your articles
as Grid, Slider, List, Slideshow, Accordion or Switcher in Joomla! with just a few clicks. Create FAQ's, Product
Overviews, Location Overviews, Testimonials, News, Blog Posts, Product Lists, Image
Slideshows, ... and much more!

## Wait - what is the difference between WidgetsBox and Exposer?

So you might think *"ey - this WidgetsBox thing, it looks familiar to me!"* - and you are right! It is inspired by our
Exposer Module and yes there are some similarities. So why did we create a new Module? Well, we wanted to create a
Module that
is easier to use and has a more intuitive interface. So we created WidgetsBox.
