# Introduction

## What is WidgetsBox?

WidgetsBox is a Content-Driven Module for Joomla! that allows you to create beautiful and responsive widgets, based on
your Joomla! Articles with ease. Every Item in WidgetsBox is a Joomla! Article. That Way you can publish your articles
as Grid, Slider, List, Slideshow, Accordion or Switcher in Joomla! with just a few clicks. Create FAQ's, Product
Overviews, Location Overviews, Testimonials, News, Blog Posts, Product Lists, Image
Slideshows, ... and much more!

## Wait - what is the difference between WidgetsBox and Exposer?

So you might think *"ey - this WidgetsBox thing, it looks familiar to me!"* - and you are right! It is inspired by our
Exposer Module and yes there are some similarities. So why did we create a new Module? Well, we wanted to create a
Module that
is easier to use and has a more intuitive interface. So we created WidgetsBox.

## But if WidgetsBox is so good, why does Exposer continue to be developed?

In fact, it was intended that WidgetsBox will be the successor of Exposer. But I've realized that Exposer has so much
more
to offer that i can't implement in WidgetsBox in this "simple" way as it is intended for WidgetsBox.
So I've decided to keep Exposer as it is and to develop WidgetsBox as a new Module. So you can use both Modules and
decide
which one fits your needs best. WidgetsBox might be easier to start with, but Exposer
includes more features and more flexibility, but is also more complex to use & learn.
