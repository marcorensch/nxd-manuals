# Structured Content

WidgetsBox can Create Structured Data from your Items. Structured Data is a standardized format that allows you to
specify information about a page and classify the page content.
The options in this section let you control the generation of structured content.

<div class="alert alert--warning" role="alert">
  <p class="alert__title"><span class="alert__title-icon">ℹ️</span> Note</p>
  <p class="alert__text">
    Only use this feature if you have defined the appropriate information for all required fields.
We do not guarantee that Google or any other search engine will use the structured data for a rich content experience.
This module only generates the code for the selected content & types.
  </p>
</div>
