# What is the BlockLayer?

Especially in combination with the Banner Layout it makes sense that your visitor cannot interact directly with the
video -
since the NXD YouTubeBox implements the video from YouTube, no direct access is possible. So we need to approach this in
a more creative way... The BlockLayer puts a (optionally transparent) layer over the entire video and prevents
visitors from clicking directly on the video.

A nice side effect of this option: the BlockLayer allows additional design options, so it is possible to provide it
with an "Inner Shadow" or a color overlay.
