# What is NXD YouTubeBox?

the NXD YouTubeBox is a frontend module for Joomla 3, 4 & 5 that integrates videos & playlists (Pro) from YouTube in a modern way
into your site. In addition to the free version of the module, there is also a Pro version available, which differs from
the free version in some additional features and removes the nx-designs watermark on the videos.
