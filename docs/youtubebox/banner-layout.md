# What is the Banner Layout?

The NXD YouTubeBox brings an exceptional feature that is not available anywhere else, the Banner Layout (formerly
HeaderMode). With the
Banner Layout you can hide a part of the video and thus limit the aspect ratio - but at the same time the complete
available width of the parent container is used:

The Banner Layout of the NXD-YouTubeBox module for Joomla! allows you to create video banners based on a YouTube video or
playlist. Thanks to autoplay, BlockLayer and various styling features, you can place beautiful, animated video banners
on your website.

## New in Version 2.x

Since release version 2.0.0, the banner layout now also supports vertical banners, known as skyscrapers. To use these,
simply define an aspect ratio with a height greater than the width in the module settings.

Checkout the [Banner Layout Demo](https://demo.nx-designs.com/youtubebox/banner-layout) for a live example.
