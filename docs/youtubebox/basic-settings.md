# Basic Settings

This section gives you a brief overview of the available Parameters of the NXD YouTubeBox.

# Module Tab

Inside the Module Tab you will find the basic parameters for the module instance.

## Basics

### Source Mode

Select here if the module instance should be in static ( default ) or dynamic mode. In dynamic mode you can define
video-id / playlist-id in relation to a Joomla! Article. When using Dynamic Option you need to define a Custom Field to
store the linked Video / Playlist ID for an Article. In static mode the Module simply shows the Video / Playlist for the
given ID in the module settings below.

### Mode

The module supports YouTube's "no-Cookie" Embed option if needed.

### Player Mode

If you have purchased NXD YouTubeBox Pro you can here select if you want to embed a Video or Playlist.

### Video / Playlist or User ID

In default mode you can here enter the Video / Playlist or User ID of the content you want to show.

## Player Options

### Fullscreen

Setting this option to No prevents the fullscreen button from displaying in the player. The default value is Yes, which
causes the fullscreen button to display.

### Autoplay

This option specifies whether the initial video will automatically start to play when the player loads.
<strong>Please be aware that most Browsers blocks this if Video Audio (Volume) is not set to muted.</strong>

### Loop

In the case of a single video player, Yes causes the player to play the initial video again and again. In the case of a
playlist player, the player plays the entire playlist and then starts again at the first video.

### Mute

Mutes the video at start - highly recommended if autoplay is to be used.

### Volume

Set the Initial Volume - will be overwritten by [Mute Option](#mute).

### Show Controls

This option indicates whether the video player controls are displayed.

### Show related

This parameter indicates whether the player should show related videos when playback of the initial video ends.

### Disable Keyboard

Setting the option's value to Yes causes the player to not respond to keyboard controls. The default value is No, which
means that keyboard controls are enabled.

### Modestbranding

This option lets you use a YouTube player that does not show a YouTube logo. Set the parameter value to Yes to prevent
the YouTube logo from displaying in the control bar.
Note a small YouTube text label will still display in the lower-right corner of a paused video or when the user's mouse
pointer hovers over the player.

### Annotations

Setting this option to Yes causes video annotations to be shown by default, whereas setting to No causes video
annotations to not be shown by default.

### Show Info

Setting the parameter's value to No causes the player to not display information like the video title and uploader
before the video starts playing.

### Video Start Time

This parameter causes the player to begin playing the video at the given number of seconds from the start of the video.
The parameter value is a positive integer.

### iOS Inline Playback

Sets the iOS Inline Playback Value which defines if the video will be played inside the page or in a separate tab /
window on touch.
