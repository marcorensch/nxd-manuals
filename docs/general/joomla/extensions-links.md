# Helpfull Links for Joomla Extensions

In Joomla there exists three main types of extensions:
- Components
- Modules
- Plugins

Other Extension Types are:
- Templates
- Languages
- Libraries
- Packages

## Install an Extension

To install an extension you have to download the extension package from the developer website. Then you can install the extension via the Joomla Extension Manager.

For most extensions and most users, the procedure will be:

- Download the extension to your local machine as a .zip file package. 
- From the Backend of your Joomla site (Administrator) select System → Install Widget → Extensions.

- Click the Upload File & Install button. 
- Some extensions may provide further instructions on installation. 
- Note that modules and plugins must be **enabled** before they will work.
